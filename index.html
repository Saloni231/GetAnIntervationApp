                Showing greater respect to older adults can be done in several
                ways : acknowledging and putting to use the talents and skills
                of older adults; creating intergenerational initiatives; and
                allowing older adults to stay active and independent for as long

              Older adults want to play active and meaningful roles in their
              lives, including as part of a social network, a neighborhood, and
              a community. Service providers and policymakers must consider that
              a lack of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age.
              Engaging them in leisure activities and volunteer work is
              important.

                Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health
                concerns in our aging society. Whilst these experiences occur
                across the life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at
                risk of social isolation and one-third will experience some
                degree of loneliness later in life. It is vital to reduce
                loneliness and social isolation among older adults.

                criteria, evaluating a range of interventions targeted at older
                people residing in the community or institutionalised settings.
